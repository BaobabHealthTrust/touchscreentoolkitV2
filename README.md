Baobab Touchscreen Toolkit Version 2.0
--------------------------------------

The Touchscreen Toolkit is a library for transforming HTML pages into touch-friendly user interfaces. This is a combination of JavaScript and CSS. It transforms standard HTML forms as they are loaded in a browser, into a set of wizard-like pages displaying  each of the input fields on separate screens. For each input field, the Touchscreen Toolkit displays a customized page with:

* Appropriate input controls
* User instructions
* Global navigation buttons (Next, Back, Cancel and Finish)
* Data validation criteria (optional)

A Touchscreen Toolkit page can be 'skipped' depending on whether an optionally specified condition for each of the fields is met or not.

Getting Started
---------------

It is pretty simple to use Touchscreen Toolkit. Just add ts.js and any of the touchscreen css files in stylesheet directory into your HTML application. For HTML forms, make sure that your HTML is standard to avoid conflicts. See examples for details.
